1. create/select a controller function where the form will be displayed
for ex : users controller , login function shows the login form

2. create the form in the views folder according to the controller.
for ex : views/users/login.php will hold the login form

for creating the form use the form helper , see the code in the view page and for other types of controls refer the links provided above


3. validations will be performed in the same controller's action only
for ex : users controller , register function contains the validation for register form

4. bootstrap for error messages

<!--Display Errors-->
<?php echo validation_errors('<p class="alert alert-dismissable alert-danger">'); ?>
 
 in the views file for better display of error / validation failed messages.

In controller the above section is for the form validation checking
it runs when the form is either loaded for the first time or some validation has failed
the else part is resposible for saving the data in the database.
