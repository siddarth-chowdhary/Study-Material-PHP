assumed : form and validations are created

1. in the controller action , if validations fails pass the error message.

2. if the validations pass ,

call the User_model login_user fucntion with arguements $username and $password

Here a query is executed to check whether onlu 1 pair of the the username and passord exists in database
If only 1 pair exists return the user_id otherwise return false as this user doesn't exists in our database.

3. back to controller , 
if it is a valid user set the session with user_id,username,logged_in(boolean value)

redirect to home/index

4. then if the user is logged in 

	a. show welcome, username in the top corner 
	b. show username instead of login form 
	c. also a logout button.

5. If the model returns no user_idor a false the show appropriate err message with the flashdata (see docs on how to create flash data).
