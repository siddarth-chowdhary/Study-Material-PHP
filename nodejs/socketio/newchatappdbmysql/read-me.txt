1.
This app works with command
nodejs server.js

2.
then open the browser at
http://localhost:5555

3.
We have used modular configurations for models so that there is no problem accessing the models 
in your code just create an object of the model 
ex:
var Chat = app.models('chat');

4. Treat this variable as a model , problem solved for "cannot redeclare the model"
