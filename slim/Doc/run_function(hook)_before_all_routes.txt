A easy solution would be to keep the non protected pages in a array, and in that hook check if the request is protected or not.

$app->hook('slim.before.dispatch', function() use ($app) { 
   $publicRoutes = array('login', 'welcome');

   if(!in_array($app->router()->getCurrentRoute(), $publicRoutes) 
       // Get the token 
       $result = API::validate($token);
       if(!$result) {
       $app->redirect('/login');
    }
});
If you want to handle a more complex process with permissions levels, oauths, etc you'll rather use a Middleware. I like them because it's the right way to do this kind of tasks with Slim, and you can reuse them.
