SQL INJECTION
-------------
SQL Injection is the hacking technique which attempts to pass SQL commands (statements) through a web application for execution by the backend database.

SQL Injection is one of the many web attack mechanisms used by hackers to steal data from organizations.

SQL Injection is type of attack that can be done through user inputs (Inputs that filled by user and then used inside queries).

The SQL Injection patterns are correct query syntax so we can call them ‘bad queries for bad reasons’.

code :
<?php
$username = $_POST['username'];
$password = $_POST['password'];

$query = "SELECT userid FROM users WHERE username = '".$username."' AND password = '".$password."'";

//providing john as username and password is provided as following: any' OR 'x' = 'x

echo $query;
?>

Output:
SELECT userid FROM users WHERE username = 'john' AND password = 'any' OR 'x'='x'

This will allow the attacker to bypass the login form without actually knowing a valid username / password combination!
